    "The COVID-19 pandemic, also known as the coronavirus pandemic, is an ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The disease was first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, China,became a Public Health Emergency of International Concern in January 2020, and subsequently recognised as a pandemic. As of 28 September 2020, more than 33.1 million cases have been reported worldwide, although the true number of cases is likely to be much higher. A better indicator for case spread is the more than 998,000 deaths attributed to COVID-19.\n",
    "\n",
    "The disease spreads between people most often when they are physically close.It spreads very easily and sustainably through the air, primarily via small droplets or particles such as aerosols, produced after an infected person breathes, coughs, sneezes, talks or sings. It may also be transmitted via contaminated surfaces, although this has not been conclusively demonstrated. It can spread for up to two days prior to symptom onset, and from people who are asymptomatic. People remain infectious for 7–12 days in moderate cases, and up to two weeks in severe cases.\n",
    "Common symptoms include fever, cough, fatigue, shortness of breath or breathing difficulties, and loss of smell. Complications may include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome. The incubation period is typically around five days but may range from one to 14 days. There are several vaccine candidates in development, although none have completed clinical trials to prove their safety and efficacy. There is no known specific antiviral medication, so primary treatment is currently symptomatic.\n",
    "\n",
    "The COVID-19 pandemic in Russia is part of the ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The virus was confirmed to have spread to Russia on 31 January 2020, when two Chinese citizens in Tyumen (Siberia) and Chita (Russian Far East) tested positive for the virus, with both cases being contained. Early prevention measures included restricting the border with China and extensive testing. The infection spread from Italy on 2 March, leading to additional measures such as cancelling events, closing schools, theatres, and museums, as well as shutting the border and declaring a non-working period which, after two extensions, lasted until 11 May 2020. By the end of March 2020, the vast majority of federal subjects, including Moscow, had imposed lockdowns. By 17 April 2020, cases had been confirmed in all federal subjects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Russia currently has the highest number of confirmed cases in Europe, and the fourth-highest in the world after the United States, India, and Brazil. According to figures from the national coronavirus crisis centre, as of 28 September 2020, Russia has 1,159,573 confirmed cases, 945,920 recoveries, 20,385 deaths, and over 45.4 million tests performed. According to mortality data published by the Federal State Statistics Service, 37,490 people with COVID-19 died from April to July 2020, with the virus determined or assumed to have been the main cause of death for 22,063 of them."
